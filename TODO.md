# TODO

## Working on

- Responsive layout

## High-priority (Required before public test)

- Responsive layout
- Create user list that you can click to filter days with their marks
- Replace color dots with simpler people icons, so I don't have to worry about how many dots show in a row and other layout crap
- Make month labels clearer, especially the first/current month
- Color scheme inspired by randoma11y.com, maybe use an outlined style?
- Auto-refresh, better indication of when app is refreshing or outdated

## Low-priority

- Create a dedicated bot (stop using D-Bot's token)
- Use JS only as progressive enhancement
- Automated database cleanup (old marks, sessions, etc)
- Use Chalk for nicer server logs
- Add slash command(s)?
- Create single-column day calendar as an alternative view (better for mobile?)
