# TODO

## Working on

- UI/UX for loading and waiting for server responses

## High-priority (Required before public test)

- Media queries for mobile (media queries can go inside selectors!)

## Low-priority

- Create a dedicated bot (stop using D-Bot's token)
- Use JS only as progressive enhancement
- Automated database cleanup (old marks, sessions, etc)
- Use rems instead of pixels for anything that should scale with font size
- Use Chalk for nicer server logs
- Add slash command(s)?
