# TODO

## High-priority

- `getMembers` takes too long; either cache it or store member info in the database, and let the server decide when to update it.
- Handle time-zone differences, specifially America vs. NZ
- Validate data coming from client
- Improve marking behavior on desktop and mobile

## Low-priority

- Change how mark types work?
- Click day to show more detail about users and their notes
- Auto-save marks
